A month ago, I went to Sichuhan with my friend and we went to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

Below is the Brief instruction of the Base.
As the world’s famous giant panda ex situ conservation base, scientific research and breeding base, public education base and educational tourism base, the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding (hereinafter referred as the Base), located at No. 1375 Outer North Panda Avenue, Chenghua District of Chengdu, Sichuan Province and covering an area of about 247 acres, is 10 kilometers from downtown Chengdu and about 30 kilometers from Shuangliu International Airport. The Base, as the “giant panda ex situ conservation ecological demonstration project”, is famous for the protection and breeding of endangered wild animals that are unique to China, including giant pandas and red pandas. It is honored as “the national treasure’s natural paradise and the people’s land of idyllic beauty” for its beautiful environment of overlapping mountains, clean water, lush trees, and chirping birds.
